Define SecurityEventSeverity enum: INFO, WARNING, HIGH, CRITICAL\\n3. Create SecurityEventData interface with flexible metadata structure\\n4. Define SecurityEventContext interface for request context (userId, deviceSessionId, ipAddress, userAgent)\\n5. Create SecurityEvent interface combining all components\\n6. Export event category mappings for automated severity determination",

Leverage existing security_events table in database, implement comprehensive event tracking for authentication, authorization, and security-related actions with proper metadata enrichment and PII sanitization.",
      "summary": "Successfully created comprehensive security event types and interfaces in types/security.ts. Implemented SecurityEventType enum with 31 event types covering authentication, authorization, password management, 2FA, device management, rate limiting, security violations, system errors, data access, and email events. Defined SecurityEventSeverity levels (INFO, WARNING, HIGH, CRITICAL) with automated severity mapping. Created flexible SecurityEventData interface with PII sanitization fields, SecurityEventContext for request enrichment, and complete SecurityEvent structure. Added helper constants for critical events, rate-limited events, and PII fields. TypeScript compilation successful with no errors.",
